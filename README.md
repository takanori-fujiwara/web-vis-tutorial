## Tutorial: How to build an interactive visualization web-application

This tutorial explains how to build a full stack web application (specifically, frontend/UI using HTML, CSS, JavaScript + backend/data processing using Python) with a special focus on interactive visualization.

Currently, WIP. But, each numbered directory shows an example of the web page/application.
You can learn how to implement an interactive web application step-by-step.
(e.g., 1_html: learn basic html, 2_css: basic css, 3_d3: simple d3 plot, ...)

How to run:
- 1_html: Launch index.html. Only texts will appear in your web browser.


- 2_css: Launch index.html. Only empty containers will appear in your web browser.


- 3_d3: Run a http server and then load index.html. For example, you can:
    - Move to `3_d3` directory.
    - Run a http server with `python3 -m http.server`.
    - Then, access http://localhost:8000/ with your browser.
  
  Only one simple scatterplot will appear.


- 4_load_data: Run a http server and then load index.html. For example, you can:
    - Move to `4_load_data` directory.
    - Run a http server with `python3 -m http.server`.
    - Then, access http://localhost:8000/ with your browser.

  A scatterplot showing the mtcars data will appear. 


- 5_lasso_selection: Run a http server and then load index.html. For example, you can:
    - Move to `5_lasso_selection` directory.
    - Run a http server with `python3 -m http.server`.
    - Then, access http://localhost:8000/ with your browser.

  The same scatterplot as 4_load_data will appear, but in this version, you can do a lasso selection by dragging a mouse over the scatterplot.


- 6_linking: Run a http server and then load index.html. For example, you can:
    - Move to `6_linking` directory.
    - Run a http server with `python3 -m http.server`.
    - Then, access http://localhost:8000/ with your browser.

  The same scatterplot as 5_lasso_selection and a node-link diagram will appear. This version links lasso selection over the scatterplot with the node-link diagram, vice versa. Note that the node position is decided randomply in this example.


- 7_use_python_via_pyodide: Run a http server and then load index.html. For example, you can:
    - Move to `7_use_python_via_pyodide` directory.
    - Run a http server with `python3 -m http.server`.
    - Then, access http://localhost:8000/ with your browser.

  This takes a slightly longer loading time (e.g., 3 seconds). This version shows a similar result to 6_linking. But, the node-link diagram is generated by the spring layout provided by a python libary, NetworkX (note: the links between nodes are randomly generated).


- 8_use_python_via_websocket: Run a websocket server and a http server, then load index.html. For example, you can:
    - Websocket server preparation
        - Move to `8_use_python_via_websocket/backend` directory.
        - Prepare Python3 environment with necessary libraries. For example, if you will use python's default virtual environment:
            - `python3 -m venv .venv`
            - `. .venv/bin/activate`
            - `pip3 install -r requirements`
        - Run a websocket server with `python3 ws_server.py`.
    - Http server preparation
        - While keeping running the websocket serer, open a new terminal tab and move to `8_use_python_via_websocket/
        - Run a http server with `python3 -m http.server`.
    - Then, access http://localhost:8000/ with your browser.

   This version shows the same result as 7_use_python_via_pyodide with a shorter loading time.
